                <li><b>41 AD</b> - Caligula was assasinated and succeeded by his uncle Claudius who exiled Seneca to Corsica on the suggestion of his wife Melessina.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>During this exile Seneca wrote his three <i>Consolations</i> or dialouges to impart stoic philosophy and potentially secure his return. </li>
      <li><i>On Anger</i> was written around this time as a study on the consequences of unchecked rage and how to control it.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>49 AD</b> - Seneca was recalled by Claudius on the instruction of his new wife Agrippina who wanted Seneca to act as tutor to her son Nero.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Seneca's very well known <i>On the shortness of life</i> was written around this time to argue that any life, regardless of length, is well lived if it is lived with reason and wisdom and not wasted on trivial pursuits.</li>
      <li>Prior to 54 AD  Seneca also wrote a number of plays. Nine tragedies survive and some of the most well known of these are <i>The Trojan Women</i>, <i>Phedra</i> and <i>Oedipus</i>.
    </ul>
    <li><b>54  - 62 AD</b> - Nero succeeded Claudius after his suspected poisoning by Agrippina. Senecca was appointed advisor to Nero and served alongside the Praetorian Prefect Burrus. During this period Seneca wrote a number of works:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>The Gourdification of the Divine Claudius</i>: A satire mocking Claudius and his descent into the afterlife.</li> 
      <li><i>On Clemency</i>: An essay written to instruct Nero on the importance of clemency in marking the difference between just rulers and tyrants.</li>
      <li><i>On the Happy Life</i>: A work written for Seneca's older brother that describes the importance of logic and reason in living a happy life.</li>

                  <li><b>62 AD</b> - Burrus died and Seneca's influence over Nero markedly declined. He was accused of misappropriation of imperial funds and excess wealth. He propmptly donated a large portion of his fortune to the emperor and asked to be allowed retire to his country estates, which was granted.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>During his retirement Seneca regularly corresponded with Lucilius, procurator of Sicily, the collective work of these letters is known as <i>moral letters to Lucilius</i>. These works are valued for their insight, not only into stoicism, but daily life in ancient Rome.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>65 AD</b> - A conspiracy to assasinate Nero was uncovered and Seneca was implicated as a potential figurehead to the conspirators. Nero ordered Seneca to commit suicide, which he did. He was later buried simply and without funeral rights in accordance with his will which was written at the height of his power and influence.</li>
